/**
 * The `RainSolver` class orchestrates the core umbrella logic for processing and settling
 * orders, it manages shared state, application configuration, order processing, and wallet
 * operations, providing high-level methods to process orders to find best trades for them
 * and broadcast them onchain.
 *
 * This class coordinates between the order manager and wallet manager to ensure that order
 * processing is performed concurrently, while respecting resource constraints. It exposes
 * methods for processing individual orders, finding optimal trades, and executing complete
 * processing rounds for batch of orders.
 *
 * The high-level methods of this class are exposed as public for easy access, while the internal
 * methods are defined in other files as standalone functions with `this` context and are used
 * to manage the flow of order processing and settlement.
